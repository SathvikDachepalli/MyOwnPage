# EXERCISE API


This is a simple Django API created for the purpose of demonstrating my skills in creating and hosting an API using Python and Django. The API is hosted on PythonAnywhere.com and is publicly accessible.

**Usage**

To use this API, you can send requests to the API endpoint and receive responses in JSON format. The API currently supports only the GET method, which allows you to retrieve data from the API.

To retrieve data from the API, you can make a GET request to the following URL:

https://dachesathvik.pythonanywhere.com
The API will return a JSON object containing the data.

**Contributing**

If you would like to contribute to this project, you can do so by sending me data in JSON format that you would like to see added to the API. To do this, please contact me via email or by opening an issue on GitHub.

To suggest a way to add a POST method to the API that would commit with your acceptance, one way would be to create a fork of the project on GitHub, add the POST method to the code, and then submit a pull request for me to review and accept. Once the pull request is accepted, the POST method will be added to the API and you will be credited as a contributor.

Thank you for your interest in this project and for considering contributing!
